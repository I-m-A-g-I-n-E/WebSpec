# WebSpec Verb Atlas v1.0.0

#
# Curated vocabulary for Tier 3 POS-Rotated Definer Verbs.
#
# Each canonical definer verb has 15-25 rotation candidates -- semantically
# equivalent verbs that can substitute for the canonical in a rotated request.
# Negative examples list verbs from OTHER families that might be confused for
# this canonical.
#
# INVARIANT: No verb appears in more than one family. A verb that is a rotation
# candidate for POST/CREATE will NEVER appear under PUT or PATCH. This is
# enforced by construction and validated at atlas-load time.
#
# INVARIANT: No verb appears as a rotation candidate for more than one
# canonical within the same family. Each verb maps to exactly one canonical.
#
# All verbs are UPPERCASE per WebSpec convention.
